Welcome to Search and Go user manual!

Use this document as a guide to navigate the system.
This application consists of a few screens: Initial screen, Main screen and Item screen.

Initial Screen
The initial screen's purpose is to notify the users of the system that this is a touch based application and since a mouse is not provided. It is the only way the application receives input other than the keyboard.

Main Screen
The main page of the application has the following objects: search bar, home (Sport check) button, language button, help button, advertisement section, and browse/results section. Below is an explanation on what each button and sections’ role is.

Home (Sport Chek) Button
This button resets the application to the default (initial) view. Search results will be discarded and browsing section will be restored to list all categories.

Search Bar
This element provides the search functionality. All one need to do is type a desired item, category or any other keyword into the box and search result will be displayed once go button on the right is pressed or enter key is hit.

Language Button
This button allows the user to switch in between English and French (not actually implemented due to the scope of the course).

Help Button
Provides the user with the readme file and calls customer service representative for help if needed.

Advertisement Section
This section has adds rotating on their own in order to inform the user about the current deals going on in the store. The user can click on one add which will cause the system to display the items that are advertised on the banner. The user can also navigate through the different ads by pressing the arrow keys on the side and also be clicking the radio buttons on the bottom of the advertisement.

Browse/Results Section
This section resides on the lower half of the screen. It is actually used for both display search results and browsing. Searching and browsing are similar actions, both involve displaying filtered result. The difference is when browsing the only filter one changes is the category, whereas when searching the filter is whatever keyword is input in the search box. Thus both results are displayed in one section.

Item Screen
This screen consists of several buttons and sections. All of them are self-explanatory; size drop down menu is used to pick the size of the item, the color drop down menu is used to choose the color etc.
